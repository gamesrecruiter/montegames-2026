# Web Design Reviewer

This skill enables visual inspection and validation of website design quality, identifying and fixing issues at the source code level.

## Scope of Application

- Static sites (HTML/CSS/JS)
- SPA frameworks such as React / Vue / Angular / Svelte
- Full-stack frameworks such as Next.js / Nuxt / SvelteKit
- CMS platforms such as WordPress / Drupal
- Any other web application

## Prerequisites

### Required

1. **Target website must be running**
   - Local development server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
   - Or open as file:// URL
   - Production environment (for read-only reviews)

2. **Browser automation must be available**
   - Screenshot capture
   - Page navigation
   - DOM information retrieval

3. **Access to source code (when making fixes)**
   - Project must exist within the workspace

## Workflow Overview

```
Step 1: Information Gathering → Step 2: Visual Inspection → Step 3: Issue Fixing → Step 4: Re-verification → Issues Remaining? → Yes: back to Step 2 / No: Completion Report
```

---

## Step 1: Information Gathering Phase

### 1.1 URL Confirmation

If the URL is not provided, ask the user:

> Please provide the URL of the website to review (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

### 1.2 Understanding Project Structure

| Item | Example Question |
|------|------------------|
| Framework | Are you using React / Vue / Next.js, etc.? |
| Styling Method | CSS / SCSS / Tailwind / CSS-in-JS, etc. |
| Source Location | Where are style files and components located? |
| Review Scope | Specific pages only or entire site? |

### 1.3 Identifying Styling Method

| Method | Detection | Edit Target |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Pure CSS | `*.css` files | Global CSS or component CSS |
| SCSS/Sass | `*.scss`, `*.sass` | SCSS files |
| CSS Modules | `*.module.css` | Module CSS files |
| Tailwind CSS | `tailwind.config.*` | className in components |
| Inline styles | Style attributes | HTML/JSX files |

---

## Step 2: Visual Inspection Phase

### 2.1 Page Traversal

1. Navigate to the specified URL
2. Capture screenshots
3. Retrieve DOM structure/snapshot (if possible)
4. If additional pages exist, traverse through navigation

### 2.2 Inspection Items

#### Layout Issues

| Issue | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Element Overflow | Content overflows from parent element or viewport | High |
| Element Overlap | Unintended overlapping of elements | High |
| Alignment Issues | Grid or flex alignment problems | Medium |
| Inconsistent Spacing | Padding/margin inconsistencies | Medium |
| Text Clipping | Long text not handled properly | Medium |

#### Responsive Issues

| Issue | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Non-mobile Friendly | Layout breaks on small screens | High |
| Breakpoint Issues | Unnatural transitions when screen size changes | Medium |
| Touch Targets | Buttons too small on mobile | Medium |

#### Accessibility Issues

| Issue | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Insufficient Contrast | Low contrast ratio between text and background | High |
| No Focus State | Cannot determine state during keyboard navigation | High |
| Missing alt Text | No alternative text for images | Medium |

#### Visual Consistency

| Issue | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Font Inconsistency | Mixed font families | Medium |
| Color Inconsistency | Non-unified brand colors | Medium |
| Spacing Inconsistency | Non-uniform spacing between similar elements | Low |

### 2.3 Viewport Testing (Responsive)

Test at the following viewports:

| Name | Width | Representative Device |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| Mobile | 375px | iPhone SE/12 mini |
| Tablet | 768px | iPad |
| Desktop | 1280px | Standard PC |
| Wide | 1920px | Large display |

## Step 3: Issue Fixing Phase

### 3.1 Issue Prioritization

- **P1: Fix Immediately** — Layout issues affecting functionality
- **P2: Fix Next** — Visual issues degrading UX
- **P3: Fix If Possible** — Minor visual inconsistencies

### 3.2 Fix Principles

1. **Minimal Changes**: Only make the minimum changes necessary to resolve the issue
2. **Respect Existing Patterns**: Follow existing code style in the project
3. **Avoid Breaking Changes**: Be careful not to affect other areas
4. **Add Comments**: Add comments to explain the reason for fixes where appropriate

---

## Step 4: Re-verification Phase

### 4.1 Post-fix Confirmation

1. Reload browser (or wait for development server HMR)
2. Capture screenshots of fixed areas
3. Compare before and after

### 4.2 Regression Testing

- Verify that fixes haven't affected other areas
- Confirm responsive display is not broken

**Iteration Limit**: If more than 3 fix attempts are needed for a specific issue, consult the user

## Best Practices

### DO (Recommended)
- ✅ Always save screenshots before making fixes
- ✅ Fix one issue at a time and verify each
- ✅ Follow the project's existing code style
- ✅ Confirm with user before major changes
- ✅ Document fix details thoroughly

### DON'T (Not Recommended)
- ❌ Large-scale refactoring without confirmation
- ❌ Ignoring design systems or brand guidelines
- ❌ Fixes that ignore performance
- ❌ Fixing multiple issues at once (difficult to verify)
